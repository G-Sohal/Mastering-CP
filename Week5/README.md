# 📚 Week 4: Graphs

## ✅ Objectives
- Develop a solid understanding of fundamental graph algorithms.
- Be able to implement these algorithms confidently and efficiently.

---

## 📘 Study Material
- Graph algorithms range from simple traversals like BFS and DFS to more complex topics (some of which are beyond our current scope).
- **Primary Source:**  
  📖 *Chapters 11–19* of the **Competitive Programmer’s Handbook**

> ⚠️ While all chapters are valuable, focus primarily on **Chapters 11–15**.  If you cam complete more, that very nice.
> 📌 Aim to understand the theory behind each algorithm and practice implementing it from scratch.  
> ❓ If you struggle with any concept, don’t hesitate to ask in the group—we’ll provide better resources or walk you through it ourselves.

## 📝 Tips
- Pay close attention to:
  - Graph representations (adjacency list/matrix)
  - Traversal order and visited arrays
  - Edge cases: disconnected components, cycles, directed vs. undirected
  - Dry-run your algorithms on small graphs for better clarity

## 📝 Note
- Many graph problems test your **logical thinking** more than just implementation.
- Try to implement algorithms like BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, and Topological Sort **from memory** by the end of the week.
