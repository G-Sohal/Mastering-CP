# üìö Week 4: Dynamic Programming

## ‚úÖ Objectives
- Understand the core concepts of **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.
- Learn to **identify DP problems** effectively during problem-solving.

---

## üìò Study Material
- **Primary Source:**  
  üìñ *Chapter 7* of the **Competitive Programmer‚Äôs Handbook**

> üîç Focus on understanding state definitions, transition logic, and memoization/tabulation techniques. 
> üîç Understand the working and implementation of both iterative and reccursive DP

## üß† Practice Problems
Solve all problems from the **CSES - Dynamic Programming** section

## üìù Tips
- Always ask:
  - What are the **states**?
  - What is the **transition**?
  - What is the **base case**?
  - Do I need to **optimize** space?

## üìù Note
- Time Complexity of a DP solution is genrally O(#state * #transitions),  unless you are doing a lot oof computation anywhere else.
