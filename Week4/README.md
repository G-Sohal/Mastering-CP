# 📚 Week 4: Dynamic Programming

## ✅ Objectives
- Understand the core concepts of **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.
- Learn to **identify DP problems** effectively during problem-solving.

---

## 📘 Study Material
- **Primary Source:**  
  📖 *Chapter 7* of the **Competitive Programmer’s Handbook**

> 🔍 Focus on understanding state definitions, transition logic, and memoization/tabulation techniques. 
> 🔍 Understand the working and implementation of both iterative and reccursive DP

---

## 🧠 Practice Problems
Solve all problems from the **CSES - Dynamic Programming** section

More Problems from CF will be added shortly.

## 📝 Tips
- Always ask:
  - What are the **states**?
  - What is the **transition**?
  - What is the **base case**?
  - Do I need to **optimize** space?

## 📝 Note
- Time Complexity of a DP solution is genrally O(#state * #transitions),  unless you are doing a lot oof computation anywhere else.
