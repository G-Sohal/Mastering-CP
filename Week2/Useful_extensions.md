# Extensions

**Advice:** As Safari does not really have a good support for most of the extensions, incase you do CP on Safari, it might be the right time to switch over to Chrome or Firefox. Firefox has by far the best support for extensions, and even allows submissions right from your VScode.

## Chrome Extensions

1. **Competitive Companion**  
   - The most useful extension in my opinion. Whe reading a problem statement, you just have to click the extension button to create a file for than problem, fetch all the provided testcases, and also easily run them via just a button to get PASS FAIL verdict along with time taken to run. It can parse pretty much any CP website/ Online Judge that you would ever use.
   - **Setup**: Download the [Competitive Companion Extension](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cjnmckjndlpiamhfimnnjmnckgghkjbl?utm_source=item-share-cb) from Chrome web store. You also require another extension on your VScode, [Competitive Programming Helper](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DivyanshuAgrawal.competitive-programming-helper) to display the fetched data. You might face some issues setting it up, but there are plenty tutorials online.
2. **Carrot Extension**  
   - Not really a must have extension. It allows you to see your expected rating change during a contest. The actual rating change is genrally off 3-4 points only.  
   - **Setup**: Just download the extension [Carrot](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gakohpplicjdhhfllilcjpfildodfnnn?utm_source=item-share-cb)

3. **CF Analytics**  
   - It provides a more extensive view of your solved problems, including rating wise count of solved problems, and your unsolved problems  
   - **Setup**: Download the extension [CF Analytics](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/hhljbjodjdbjbggddjaidojnlmaobcpo?utm_source=item-share-cb)

4. **Codeforces Practice Tracker**  
   - Lets you see your solved problems in time intervals, their average rating, and your rating in that period.  
   - **Setup**: Downlaod the extension [Codeforces Practice Tracker](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/cnahgdhboflcnojgmeehhhfeoojifonm?utm_source=item-share-cb)

## VS Code Extensions

1. **IntelliSense**  
    Built-in VS Code feature that offers smart code completions based on variable types, function definitions, and imported modules.  

1. **Code Runner**  
    I believe that most of you would already have that, but just in case someone doesn't. When you are getting ```SIGSEV```, the Competitive companion doesn't display any other ```cout``` statement that you might put. I such cases, and many more to be honest, you might need to quickly run it on your terminal, this extension just does that. Also you can put flags like ```-std=c++20``` in the extension map from the setting. 
2. **GitHub Copilot**  
    Well, this one is kind of in the grey area. Since most of you probably have it already, I'll just give some tips for its usage.
     - During practice, just turn it off and write all your code on your own. I know it gets tiring writing 250 lines of code, but trust me, this is how you develop speed and confidence while coding. You might make mistakes and get stuck with some bugs, but thats how you are going to gain experience and be vigilant more time.
     - During contest, use it only for part like taking in the input or initialising data structures. For writing the core logic of your code, its way better to write it manually. As Copilot suggestions are mostly the probable code, it might screw you over someday when you blindly trust it.

## Configuration

Most of these extensions offer range of customizations, so do have a look at the settings of these extensions. Like the coderunner by default might not be compiling with the latest version of the compiler, giving errors on lambda functions etc., scram through the settings and fix it yourself.
