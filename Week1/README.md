## 🔧 Make your own C++ Template

> Do not cluster your template as of now, just basics includes, `#defines`, and starting `int main` code is enough.  
> I would recommend adding any algorithm in your code only after you have the ability to code it yourself.  
> Templates are just for saving time and not for escaping the need to understand how to write the code.
> Also download bits/stdc++.h if not already present

## 📚 Weekly Reading Plan

**Please review Chapters 1 through 4 of CP Handbook during the first week**  
These chapters cover the fundamental concepts of CP, sufficient for most problems up to a 1400 rating.  
Following your self-paced reading of the book, you may begin practicing.

- **Chapter 1**: Introduction to the CP world.
- **Chapter 2**: Time complexity — a crucial concept when solving or analyzing problems.
- **Chapter 3**: Sorting and binary search — likely familiar from a CS101 course.
- **Chapter 4**: A significant amount of information on data structures.  
  Basic understanding is sufficient. Review:
  - Sets
  - Maps
  - Vectors
  - Strings

## 🧩 Additional Practice

> Apart from this, start solving **800–1200 rated** questions (if you are not rated above 1200).  
> Ideally, all questions below 1200 will not require any algorithms, and can be done using basic CS101 knowledge.
