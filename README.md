# Mastering-CP
Summer Of Code - Project ID : 35 - Mastering CP

Mentors: Sameer, Jatsya, Harsh, Abhi

Timeline:

Week 1: C++ STL, Sorting, and Searching Get comfortable with C++ STL containers. Build your own CP templates and learn classic sorting algorithms with time complexity analysis. 

Week 2: Greedy Algorithms and Bit Manipulation Explore greedy strategies through classic problems. Practice useful bitwise operations and tricks.

Week 3: Mathematics and Number Theory Cover essential math topics including modular arithmetic, exponentiation, eratosthemes, combinatorics, and basic probability, mobius function and euler totient function.

Week 4: Dynamic Programming Practice all 5 forms of DP. Learn how to identify DP problem.

Week 5: Complete Graph Theory Learn graph representations and traversal algorithms, work with trees, shortest path algorithms and MSTs.

Week 6: String Algorithms Study key string techniques including pattern matching, trie data structures and suffix arrays.

Week 7: Segment Trees and Fenwick Trees Dive into advanced data structures for range queries and point updates.
